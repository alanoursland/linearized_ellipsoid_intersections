# Experiment 12: PCA Mahalanobis Approximation 

## Goal

To evaluate a fast approximation to Mahalanobis distance using a fixed number of principal components per ellipsoid. We compare this to full Mahalanobis (elliptical), Euclidean (spherical), and variations using L2 and L1 norms over principal components.

## Background

### Full Mahalanobis Distance (Elliptical)

For a point \( x \) and ellipsoid \( (\mu, \Sigma) \), the Mahalanobis distance is:

\[
d(x, \mu, \Sigma) = \sqrt{(x - \mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} (x - \mu)}
\]

This measures the distance in a space normalized by the covariance of the ellipsoid. It requires a full matrix inverse and quadratic form, which is computationally expensive.

---

### Spherical Distance (Euclidean)

This is the special case where all ellipsoids are spheres:

\[
d(x, \mu) = \|x - \mu\|_2
\]

It's simple and fast but ignores ellipsoidal shape — all directions are treated equally.

---

### PCA Mahalanobis Distance (This Experiment)

Rather than inverting the full covariance matrix, we use an eigen-decomposition:

\[
\Sigma = V \Lambda V^\top
\]

Where:
- \( V \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D} \) are orthonormal eigenvectors (principal directions)
- \( \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D} \) is diagonal with eigenvalues (variances)

To approximate Mahalanobis distance, we use only the top \( r \) eigenpairs:

\[
d_{\text{PCA}}(x, \mu) = \left\| \frac{V_r^\top (x - \mu)}{\sqrt{\lambda_r}} \right\|_p
\]

Where:
- \( V_r \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times r} \) are the top principal components
- \( \lambda_r \in \mathbb{R}^r \) are corresponding eigenvalues
- \( \|\cdot\|_p \) is either L2 or L1 norm

This drops components in low-variance directions and treats ellipsoids as locally low-rank. It avoids full matrix inversion and reduces each ellipsoid to a linear projection + norm.

## Observations

- **PCA-L2 performance scales smoothly** with more components, and with as few as 4–8 principal directions, it can match or beat spherical and even full elliptical reconstruction.
- **PCA-L1 underperforms** consistently — the L1 norm doesn't align well with gradient-based optimization in this setting.
- **Runtime improves dramatically**: PCA with 4 components gives near-optimal performance in **4 seconds** compared to 65+ for the full method.
- **PCA-L2 with 64 components** achieves **lowest final error** in the experiment, indicating that many ellipsoids are well-approximated with just a subspace.

---

## Notes on Accuracy

While the results are compelling, this experiment:

- Uses a **single random initialization and sample** for each configuration
- Was **not repeated** over multiple trials
- Does **not report confidence intervals or variance**

Therefore, results are **not statistically significant** and should be interpreted as exploratory and illustrative.

---

## Conclusion

Approximating Mahalanobis distance via a truncated PCA basis is a **highly effective and efficient strategy**. It avoids matrix inversion, reduces dimensionality, and significantly speeds up optimization while preserving accuracy. L2 norms over principal directions outperform both L1 norms and traditional spherical approximations.

This opens up possibilities for:

- Adaptive component selection
- Per-ellipsoid rank estimation
- Compressed or shared PCA bases

PCA-based Mahalanobis is a strong candidate for real-time or large-scale reconstruction problems.
